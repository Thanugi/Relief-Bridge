PROMPT TO GENERATE THE PLATFORM

Build a complete, responsive website called “ReliefBridge” — a disaster-relief coordination platform for Sri Lanka’s recent disaster event.
This website should allow affected people, relatives, volunteers, donors, and NGOs to collaborate, report cases, and access public information.
Please read the full requirements carefully and implement the exact design + functionality as described.

⭐ 1. General Requirements

Purpose:
A public, open, transparent platform that lets the community help each other during a disaster.

Key principles:

Clean

Calm

Professional

Monotone / minimal color palette

No multicolored emojis — replace with simple outline icons, shapes, or minimal symbols

Fully responsive (mobile-first, tablet, desktop)

Color theme:

Choose ONE calm, modern color family (e.g., green, light blue, cool gray)

Use different shades of that same color

Avoid bright, playful, or multicolored visuals

Aim for a soft, modern, humanitarian look

⭐ 2. Platform Structure

The website should include the following main tabs, sub-tabs, and pages:

A. Landing Page (Professional & Minimal)

Include:

Simple hero section describing what ReliefBridge is

Why it exists (community-driven disaster support)

How the platform helps

Buttons to access main features

Calm monotone visuals

Simple geometric icons instead of emojis

Short text explaining each section

B. Main Features / Tabs

Add option to upload photos

Add option to download the report as PDF or CSV

Sorting, filtering, searching

Allow users to download filtered reports as PDF or CSV

Entire database visible — open to the public

Every major list should support downloading as:

PDF

CSV

Design Replacements

Replace all emojis with modern outline icons

Use monochromatic shapes

Maintain minimalist visual design

⭐ 5. Additional Requirements
Platform behavior

Responsive on all devices

User-friendly

Fast

Clean UI spacing

Professional structure

Beta version acceptable but must look polished

Deployment

After generating the full project, the AI should:

Prepare it for deployment on Vercel

Provide a build folder, environment variables needed, and Firebase config

Ensure all routes use client-side routing (Next.js preferred)

⭐ 6. After Building — Tell Me the Next Steps

At the end of the project generation, please add a section explaining:

How to set up Firebase for public access

How to deploy on Vercel

How to test the site after deployment

How to monitor uptime issues

How to maintain the public database

How to run the beta version

How to expand it in the future
